## Hi, Iâ€™m Collins. ðŸ«¡

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page. I am an aspiring graphics designer and full-stack developer (hence the asterisk). I have always been interested in coding, so at the beginning of 2024, I started my coding journey. I mostly dabble in the front end but am getting to know the back end day after day. Â I enjoy using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Iâ€™m currently learning React and Python, then plan to eventually move onto three.js and C++ (for the unreal engine). Â Please take a look at some of my projects, please do keep in mind I'm still only a beginner.
