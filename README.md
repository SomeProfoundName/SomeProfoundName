## Hi, I’m Collins. 🫡

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page. I am an aspirating graphics designer and full stack developer (hence the asterisk). I have always been interested in coding, so at the beginning of 2024, I started my coding journey. I mostly dabble in the front end, but am getting to know the back end day after day.  I enjoy using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I’m currently learning React and Python, then eventually to move onto three.js and C++ (for unreal).  Please take a look at some of my projects, but please be nice, I'm still only a beginner.
